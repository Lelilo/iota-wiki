In this article you will learn how the IOTA Smart Contracts interact with the IOTA Tangle.

As Smart Contracts can automate contractual obligations within many industries, they are essential across many of IOTA’s verticals including [Supply Chains](https://www.iota.org/solutions/global-trade-and-supply-chains), [Smart Cities](https://www.iota.org/solutions/smart-city), and [Industrial IoT](https://www.iota.org/solutions/industrial-iot) amongst others.

Thanks to the Tangle’s properties of scalability, high throughput, and feeless transactions, IOTA Smart Contracts have many benefits.

To facilitate IOTA’s use cases, including the Internet of Things, IOTA Smart Contracts run on top of the base layer - Layer 1 (L1), ”off-Tangle”.

Although Ethereum’s “on-chain” smart contracts are popular, they have some significant drawbacks. The most salient one is that for every smart contract in existence every node needs to keep a copy of the contract’s program code and state. Every node in the network has to execute the exact same code when the smart contract is triggered.

There is no limit to the number of nodes that have to run this identical code just to generate a single result. And as the network grows, the amount of processing needed to produce that same result increases. This is a huge barrier to scalability.

In addition to the transaction fees you need to pay to be considered for inclusion in the ledger, you also need to pay gas fees to keep the program running long enough for it to complete. This means the cost to run these smart contracts becomes prohibitively high for anything but certain classes of use cases where the cost overhead is relatively insignificant.

This is why IOTA Smart Contracts are not implemented as part of the core protocol but as a layer 2 (L2) protocol to leverage all the advantages.

## Architecture Overview

The IOTA Smart Contracts implementation has successfully evolved since its initial experimental phase on [IOTA 2.0 DevNet](https://v2.iota.org/visualizer), powered by the research [GoShimmer nodes](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer). The team's primary focus was to support smart contracts on the mainnet using the Hornet node software, and they have almost achieved this goal with the release of the "Stardust" version. This milestone has led to the creation of the [Shimmer Network](https://shimmer.network/), where WASP is now a Hornet plugin.

As a result of these advancements, the Shimmer Network now hosts the public ShimmerEVM Testnet, enabling developers to build and test smart contracts written in Solidity. With WASP designed as an INX plugin, it is necessary for developers to run the WASP node alongside their own Hornet node. To simplify this process, the team provides a convenient docker-compose setup for easy deployment and management of both nodes.

The updated IOTA Smart Contracts implementation on the Shimmer Network, with WASP as a Hornet plugin and the availability of the ShimmerEVM Testnet, showcases the team's commitment to innovation and progress in the IOTA ecosystem.
